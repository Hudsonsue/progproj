HEA enrolment figures include other CAO applicants without CAO points (FETAC & MATURE for example) so I had no means of determining the CAO Leaving Certificate intake cohort. For the purpose of this project I decided to assume a uniform distribution of students across programmes and made **max points= median+(median-final)**.

For the purpose of this dataset the student/programme level is based on total full time Enrolments for GMIT L6/7/8 as % of total enrolments for GMIT.

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "This has been an enjoyable project and I feel I have learnt much from it. In hindsight I would have been better to choose a dataset to build that I knew nothing about and also one that was not as vast in terms of available variables! \n",
    "I might also have chosen one with variables that had clearer and more direct relationships. To properly show student data I would need to look at many more variables as there are multiple factors/relationships involved in the production of HEA statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However I feel that I could use the skills that I have developed to properly analyse the available data and to put the output of such analysis to good use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project I veered from my initial plan which was simply to create a dataset to one where I wanted to show how such data might be looked at to highlight potential at risk students. I also considered allowing a user to define the dataset size and included a user input box, I decided however to rempve this again to allow the data to run based on a 200 person dataset. In the initial stages I used randon seeds to keep data static while I worked on variables, I removed seeds once happy with my variables as I think it is better when you can see data change upon repeat running.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has also sharply highlighted the importance of taking time to scope and plan, concepts that are almost alien in a workplace that tends to be reactive. If I take one thing from this course I hope it will be to insist that time be spent on the planning phase of work projects!"
