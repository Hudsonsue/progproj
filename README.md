# ## Project Programming for Data Analytics 2018

This is a Jupyter Notebook in which I have simulated a dataset of typical student data in the Irish Higher Education Sector. 

It is a submission by student ID G00219132. 
    
The submission is for Project 2018 for the Module **Programming for Data Analytics** The module is delivered as part of the [Higher Diploma in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/computing/higher-diploma-science-computing-data-analytics-ict-skills) in [Galway Mayo IT](https://www.gmit.ie/), Galway.

The notebook is called **Project_Programming_Data_Analytics.ipynb** and to run it you will ideally have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)installed on your machine. You can install this via the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) python Distribution.  

It is in programming language - Python 3.7.0.For some information about Python and it's uses see the wikipedia page, [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

The project instructions can be found in the pdf called project.pdf within this repository.

**Please note that all data in this notebook is simulated and not actual**
